# Infrastructure

Everything in here is for implementing non-functional requirements.

## Meta

Everything in here wants to be something that is supplied by either
* reusable libraries
* a project template or host (that can be updated as changes happen to it)

so that it's very low effort to encourage consistency between apps.

I'd like this directory to be as slim as possible, while retaining the ability for component owners to be opinionated. Fine balance!
